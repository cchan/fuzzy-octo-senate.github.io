<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
			<p>Most offices are voted on in the spring.  Freshmen positions are
voted on in the fall.  Students must complete nomination papers to
become a candidate for any elected student office. <br /></p>
<div class="small">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Nomination Procedure</span><br />
1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pick up nomination papers at the designated location.<br />
2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Obtain the requisite number of signatures (50) from your classmates.<br />
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Submit the papers by the due date.<br />
4)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The earlier you turn in your nomination papers, the higher on the ballot your name will appear.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Campaign Statements</span><br />
Candidates for all offices except Class Council must post a campaign
statement saying why you are running for office on the designated
bulletin board in Commons I.&nbsp; This must be on a single 8½&#8221; x 11&#8221;
sheet of paper.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Running for Multiple Offices</span><br />
You may run for more than one office.&nbsp; However, you must submit
separate nomination papers for each office, with the exception of the
combination of Class Office/Class Council.&nbsp; You may not hold more
than one office.&nbsp; If you are elected to multiple positions, you
must resign all but one.&nbsp; This allows for greater participation
and diversity of officeholders.<br />
Publicity and Posters<br />
All campaign signs and posters must be initialed by a faculty Senate
member.&nbsp; Please get the original signed before making
copies!&nbsp; Campaign posters may not be hung before the designated
date.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Campaign Ethics</span><br />
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Total campaign expenditures may not exceed $25.00,
including, but not limited to, printing expenses for campaign posters
and items to give away to potential voters.&nbsp; The actual retail
value of any items provided to the candidate for free or at a
significant discount will also count toward the $25.00 cap.<br />
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In accordance with school rules, candidates may not
distribute food items, including candy, to potential voters.<br />
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Candidates are permitted to distribute small items
to potential voters, so long as the following conditions are met:<br />
o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The spending and food restrictions are followed.<br />
o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The items are evenly distributed without any
understanding that accepting the item constitutes an obligation to vote
for that candidate.<br />
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All candidates will be required to sign on their
nomination form that they are aware of and agree to abide by these
rules.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Voting</span><br />
Voting takes place in homerooms. You must have a No. 2 pencil to vote as we use Scantron ballots.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Elected Positions<br />
<br />
</span>School Government<br />
Lexington High School Student/Faculty Senate: The Senate determines
policies and rules for the school, as determined by the Lexington High
School Constitution. It is made up of teachers and students who meet
together during X Block. Each class elects approximately ten senators
(the number of senators varies with the total school enrollment each
year according to the rules in the LHS Senate Constitution).&nbsp;
Please be aware that the Senate has a strict attendance policy, so
please only run if you can commit to attending Senate meetings.<br />
<br />
Board of Appeals: The Board of Appeals consists of four students (one
from each grade) and two faculty members, all elected for a one-year
term. The purpose of the Board of Appeals is to address student and
teacher grievances. The Board of Appeals also handles Community Service
appeals.<br />
<br />
School Council Representative: One rising sophomore and one rising
junior are elected to serve a one-year and two-year term, respectively,
to the LHS School Council.&nbsp; The Council consists of parent,
faculty, student, and community representatives and serves as an
advisory committee to the administration and is responsible for
creating the annual School Improvement Plan.<br />
<br />
School Committee Representative: One student is elected at large to
serve as a non-voting student delegate to the Lexington School
Committee.&nbsp; The School Committee is responsible for policy issues
at the district level and with the school budget process.<br />
Class Representation<br />
<br />
Class Officers: Your class will elect students to the following class offices:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;President<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Vice President<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Secretary<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Treasurer<br />
These officers are responsible for running the Class Council.<br />
<br />
Class Council:&nbsp; This group, made up of 16 members of your class,
helps raise money to fund activities, plan class activities such as
Semi, Cruise, and Prom, and improve school spirit.&nbsp; Each class
council also has at least one faculty advisor.<br />
